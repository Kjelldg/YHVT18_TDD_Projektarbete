# YHVT18_TDD_Projektarbete

This repository contains a project contributed to by four collaborators. 

The project entails a minimalistic game where the user can move a tile on a tile board (created in Swing). 
The objective of the game is to collect treasures and avoid a brutal death by cruel, unforgiving lasers. 

Move the player by using the arrow keys.
